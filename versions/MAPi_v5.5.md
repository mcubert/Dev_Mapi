# 🧠 MAPi v5.5 — Manifest‑Aware Prompt Interpreter

*A pattern language for drift‑resistant, audit‑enforced, adaptive agentic AI orchestration — with modular Quantum Readiness & Runaway Guardrails*

**Version:** 5.5  

**Status:** Authoritative, posterity‑ready  

**Purpose:** MAPi is a governance‑first, inheritance‑safe framework for designing, tuning, and orchestrating AI agents. It enumerates governance heuristics (PG), rulesets (RS), metrics, and scenario validations to ensure agents remain drift‑resistant, auditable, and adaptable over time. Governance roles themselves are embodied as cooperating agents, exchanging messages to execute the manifest in real time. In v5.5, Chunks 9, 11, and 17 are upgraded with metrics‑integrated validation, automation hooks, and threshold‑gated change control.  

**Scope:** This manifest is domain‑agnostic and modular. Chunks 1–4 define the classical core; Chunk 5 adds an opt‑in control plane for early‑stage quantum readiness and runaway prevention; Chunks 9, 11, and 17 now embed automation‑ready governance and benchmarking.  

**Usage:** Each new agent inherits from MAPi Prime, toggling PG/RS as mandatory or optional, and may extend with agent‑specific rules. All changes are versioned for audit and legacy handoff, with v5.5 enforcing before/after metrics capture, commit‑tagged artifacts, and automated ritual execution.

### **What’s New in v5.5**  
*(See Change Log entry `CHG-2025-09-04-MAPi-v5.5` in `/MAPi_Prime/Change_Logs/`)*

- **Chunk 9 — Change Management & Version Control**  
  - Added **PG‑CM8** (metrics‑integrated validation mandate) and **PG‑CM9** (automation traceability).  
  - New **RS‑CM108** (automated inbox state update), **RS‑CM109** (threshold gate), and **RS‑CM110** (commit & tag).  
  - All changes now require before/after metrics capture; breaches block activation or trigger rollback.

- **Chunk 11 — Governance Rituals & Cadence**  
  - All rituals are **automation‑ready** and **metrics‑instrumented**.  
  - Ritual outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to related change logs, scenarios, and metrics snapshots.  
  - Missed rituals must be logged with reason; cadence overrides supported for high‑risk agents.

- **Chunk 17 — Archetype Performance Benchmarking**  
  - Benchmarks now run via automation runner with archetype‑level configs.  
  - Before/after metrics capture with deltas; breaches trigger RS‑CM109 threshold gate.  
  - Outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to metrics, scenarios, and change logs.

## **Chunk 0.2 — Quick‑Start Governance Playbook** *(v5.5 adjustments)*

*Purpose:* Provide a minimal, high‑impact guide to operating MAPi Prime and its agents in compliance with the full v5.5 framework. This is not a replacement for the full manifest — it’s the field‑ready version.

---

### **1 — Core Mindset**

- **MAPi Prime is the law** — all agents inherit from it unless explicitly overridden.
- **PG/RS codes are contracts** — if you change them, you log them (Chunk 9).
- **Metrics and scenarios are your truth** — if they say something’s wrong, it’s wrong.

---

### **2 — Agent Lifecycle in 7 Moves**

1. **Create** — Use **Chunk 6** workflow. Pick archetype, set PG/RS toggles, bind tools, tag version.
2. **Wire Metrics** — Apply **Chunk 7** schema before first run.
3. **Dry‑Run Validate** — Run **Chunk 8** scenarios; fix breaches before go‑live.
4. **Deploy** — Move to production only after passing validation.
5. **Govern** — Follow **Chunks 9–12** for change control, roles, rituals, and repository discipline.
6. **Respond** — Use **Chunks 13–14** for incidents and continuity.
7. **Retire/Evolve** — Apply **Chunks 15–17** for decommissioning, archetype management, and benchmarking.

---

### **3 — Daily/Weekly Habits**

- **Daily:** Check metrics dashboard (MT1–MT6, MT‑Q), scan for drift, triage escalations.
- **Weekly:** Spot‑run RS8 scenarios, review draft changes, monitor trends.
- **Monthly:** Full metrics audit, regression suite, policy effectiveness review.
- **Quarterly:** Archetype portfolio review, MAPi Prime drift audit.
- **Annually:** Strategic governance review, full manifest re‑certification.

---

### **4 — Change Management in 5 Steps** *(Chunk 9 — v5.5)*

1. Log the change proposal in the Change Log.
2. Run impact analysis (affected PG/RS, agents, scenarios, metrics).
3. Validate with RS8 scenarios **and capture Metrics_Before/After**; reject if thresholds breached.
4. Approve via governance authority.
5. Increment version, commit/tag artifacts, update inbox, monitor post‑change metrics.

---

### **5 — Incident Response in 6 Steps** *(Chunk 13)*

1. Detect (metrics breach, scenario fail, manual report).
2. Contain (isolate agent, secure data, kill switch if quantum).
3. Investigate (root cause, impact, preserve evidence).
4. Resolve (apply fix, validate, restore).
5. Review (lessons learned, policy updates, baseline reset).
6. Close (log in repository).

---

### **6 — Continuity & Fallback** *(Chunk 14)*

- Pre‑approve fallback agents, tools, and offline manifests.
- Trigger fallback on outage, containment, or tool failure.
- Always governance‑check before fallback activation.

---

### **7 — Archetype Governance** *(Chunks 16–17 — v5.5)*

- Treat archetypes like agents: version, validate, log changes.
- Benchmark quarterly via automation; capture before/after metrics; evolve or retire underperformers if thresholds breached.

---

### **8 — Repository Discipline** *(Chunk 12)*

- Store **everything**: manifests, change logs, metrics, scenario results, incident reports.
- Index by Agent ID, Manifest Version, Date, Artifact Type.
- Never overwrite history — corrections create new entries.

---

### **9 — The Golden Loop**

Metrics → Scenarios → Governance Decisions → Change Log → Version Increment → Metrics

This loop is the heartbeat of MAPi. In v5.5, metrics capture and threshold gates are embedded in every governance cycle.

## **Chunk 2A — Collaboration & Operational Layer**

*Purpose:* Multi‑agent coordination and self‑reflection patterns. This section covers **Inter‑Agent Dialogue Patterns** and **Reflective Agency Patterns** in full.*

### X. Inter‑Agent Dialogue Patterns

| RS Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RS6.140 | Agent‑as‑Tool Invocation | One agent calls another to perform a specific subtask. Invocation includes role, scope, and expected output. |
| RS6.141 | Predictive Transparency | Agent explains anticipated actions or reasoning path before execution to build trust and interpretability. |
| RS6.142 | Metacognitive Annotation | Tag each reasoning step with source, strategy, or confidence; enable traceability and audit. |
| RS6.143 | Signature‑Conditioned Reasoning | Reason according to agent’s cognitive fingerprint (e.g., skeptical, analogical, detail‑oriented). |
| RS6.144 | Theory‑of‑Mind Injection | Simulate how another agent would interpret or reason through a situation. |
| RS6.145 | Divergence‑Aware Communication | Explicitly highlight points of disagreement or differing perspectives for ensemble synthesis. |
| RS6.146 | Trust Calibration | Adjust reliance on other agents based on performance history and reliability scores. |
| RS6.147 | Cognitive Translation | Bridge representational gaps between agents with different reasoning styles or vocabularies. |
| RS6.148 | Collaborative Debug | Work together to identify and resolve errors; shared error rituals and rollback logic. |
| RS6.149 | Cognitive Team Composition | Assemble complementary agent teams (e.g., pattern‑matcher with a skeptic). |
| RS6.150 | Meta‑Learning Update | Learn from collaboration and update heuristics/behavior accordingly. |
| RS6.151 | Cognitive Conflict Invocation | Pair divergent reasoning styles to challenge assumptions and surface blind spots. |
| RS6.152 | Perspective‑Switch | Simulate how another agent would solve a problem based on their cognitive style; compare outcomes. |
| RS6.153 | Real‑Time Attribution | Tag contributions live with author, style, and expected result for audit and synthesis. |
| RS6.154 | Theory‑of‑Mind Simulation | Simulate another agent’s full reasoning chain — not just conclusions but step‑by‑step logic. |

### XI. Reflective Agency Patterns

| --- | --- | --- |
| RS6.160 | Self‑Critique Loop | Review and critique own outputs; identify flaws or gaps. |
| RS6.161 | Confidence Calibration | Implement the confidence reporting routine mandated by PG6.30. |

| RS6.165 | Escalation Trigger Prompting | Define conditions for human handoff or external intervention. |
| RS6.166 | Retry with Modifications | Retry tasks with targeted adjustments based on prior failures. |

## **Chunk 2B — Operational Governance & Hygiene Layer**

*Purpose:* This section defines the governance rules for how agents manage tools, enforce operational discipline, and maintain semantic hygiene. It also codifies the Priming Groups (PG1–PG7) — the high‑level governance heuristics that underpin all RS implementations. Together, these rules ensure that every agent operates within clear, auditable boundaries, preserves context integrity, and can adapt policies without introducing drift.*

### XII. Tool Governance Patterns

| RS Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RS6.170 | Model Context Protocol | Manage context window explicitly; control inclusion, eviction, and compression. |
| RS6.171 | Agentic Persistence Priming | Maintain agent identity across interactions; reinforce role and constraints. |
| RS6.172 | Tool Use Governance | Define tool constraints, preconditions, allowed operations, and logging requirements. |
| RS6.173 | Planning‑Reflection Sandwich | Plan → Execute → Reflect cadence for tool‑assisted tasks. |
| RS6.174 | Positional Reinforcement | Use instruction placement to emphasize priority and persistence. |
| RS6.175 | Role Override via Ordering | When instructions conflict, later, higher‑priority role assertions take precedence. |
| RS6.176 | State Mode Switching | Switch agent state via explicit role assertion; log state changes. |
| RS6.177 | Tool Schema Hygiene | Ensure tool schemas are clearly defined and consistently used. |
| RS6.178 | Failure Mode Preemption | Anticipate and mitigate known tool failure modes; add guards. |
| RS6.179 | Tool Descriptions | Provide clear metadata for all tools (inputs, outputs, risks, examples). |

### XIII. Semantic Hygiene Checklist

| RS Code | Ritual Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RS6.180 | Paste Errors Whole | Paste full error messages/stack traces/logs; never paraphrase; preserve diagnostic fidelity. |
| RS6.181 | Create New Chats | Start fresh threads for distinct tasks; prevent context bleed. |
| RS6.182 | Restore Previous | Rehydrate known‑good threads to continue work; avoid re‑priming. |
| RS6.183 | Use Templates | Apply reusable scaffolds; enforce structure and reduce ambiguity. |
| RS6.184 | Commit Often | Save prompt iterations frequently; enable rollback and versioning. |
| RS6.185 | Secure Secrets | Do not paste credentials; use PRIVATE_ tags or vaults. |
| RS6.186 | Iterate and Refine | Limit to 3 iterations unless new constraints or feedback are introduced. |
| RS6.187 | Use Agent Mode | Activate explicit roles (e.g., “You are a compliance auditor...”); enforce behavior boundaries. |
| RS6.188 | Deploy Early | Test in a representative environment once baseline compliance is met. |
| RS6.189 | Keep Prompt Records | Maintain a prompt/version log for reuse and audit. |
| RS6.190 | Run Locally, Test Frequently | Prefer local/sandbox tests for reproducibility. |
| RS6.191 | Clone/Fork Wisely | Duplicate only when necessary; use clear naming and purpose tags. |
| RS6.192 | Use Current Released LLMs for Discovery | Use high‑capacity, currently released models (e.g., GPT‑4.1, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5) for exploratory/ambiguous tasks; avoid outdated or experimental builds in production. |
| RS6.193 | Edit Transcripts | Clean auto‑transcribed input before reuse to prevent lexical noise and misinterpretation. |
| RS6.194 | Shape the Vibes | Maintain tone and clarity consistent with role; avoid jargon unless specified. |

### Priming Groups (PG1–PG7) — Governance Heuristics

| PG Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PG1.1 | Manifest Discipline | Enforce schema compliance across prompts and workflows. |
| PG1.2 | Drift Detection Trigger | Flag semantic/structural drift early. |
| PG1.3 | Assumption Flagging | Identify implicit assumptions in prompts, defaults, and data mappings. |

    - *Monthly:* Deep dive with RS8 scenario validation results and regression test outcomes.
- **Formats:**
    - *Dashboard:* Gauges for MT1–MT6, traffic‑light thresholds, drill‑downs.
    - *Audit Report:* Summary, metric tables, top recurring violations, corrective actions.

| 2 | Prioritize PG (governance) over RS (implementation) unless PG explicitly delegates. |
| 3 | If both are PG or both are RS, defer to the more restrictive rule. |
| 4 | Log the conflict, resolution decision, and rationale. |
| 5 | If unresolved, escalate to human governance authority. |

## **Chunk 5 — Quantum Readiness & Runaway Guardrails**

*Purpose:* This chunk provides a minimal, high‑integrity control plane for safely engaging with early‑stage quantum capabilities in hybrid AI systems. It is **opt‑in** — dormant unless a workflow explicitly declares quantum use — and is designed to prevent uncontrolled escalation (“quantum runaway”), protect sensitive data and models, and ensure ethical/governance compliance. Other PG/RS codes in Chunks 1–4 may reference these rules when quantum workflows are invoked.*

### **PG‑Q — Quantum Governance Heuristics**

| PG Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PG‑Q1 | Quantum Use Declaration | Require explicit declaration when quantum resources are invoked. |

### **Scenario Validation Hooks (RS8 Cross‑Reference)**

- **Quantum Runaway Simulation** — Simulate a quantum job with runaway potential; verify RS‑Q101 blocks or escalates.
- **PQC Breach Attempt** — Attempt to send sensitive data without PQC; verify RS‑Q103 blocks transmission.
- **Output Drift Test** — Run identical quantum jobs multiple times; verify RS‑Q102 flags instability.

### **Integration Notes**

- **Opt‑In Activation:** PG‑Q1 is the trigger — if a workflow declares quantum use, Chunk 5 rules become active.
- **Cross‑References:**
    - RS6.165 (Escalation Trigger Prompting) — used by RS‑Q104.
    - RS8 (Scenario Validation) — extended with quantum scenarios.
    - Metrics & Telemetry — MT‑Q entries appended to MT1–MT6.
- **Runaway Prevention:** PG‑Q2 + RS‑Q101/RS‑Q104 form the “kill switch” for unsafe quantum escalation.

## **Chunk 6 — Agent Creation Workflow**

*Purpose:* Define the repeatable, auditable process for creating a new agent from MAPi Prime, ensuring all governance, orchestration, and measurement layers are active from day one. This workflow guarantees that every agent inherits the MAPi discipline, is metrics‑ready, and passes scenario validation before deployment.*

### **Phase 0 — Pre‑Creation Alignment**

**Goal:** Ensure the agent’s purpose, scope, and constraints are explicit before instantiation.

1. **Declare Agent Identity**
    - Assign **Agent Name** and **Role Assertion** (PG2.1).
    - Define **scope boundaries** (RS2.46) and **exclusions**.
2. **Select Archetype**
    - Choose from your archetype library (e.g., compliance auditor, research synthesizer, hybrid quantum‑classical orchestrator).
    - Archetype determines default PG/RS toggles.
3. **Define Objectives & KPIs**
    - Map to **MT1–MT6** (and MT‑Q if relevant).
    - Set thresholds for drift, error, iteration efficiency, etc.
4. **Risk & Ethics Review**
    - Apply PG6.32 (Assumption Debugging) to surface hidden risks.
    - If quantum use is possible, pre‑load PG‑Q1–Q5.

### **Phase 1 — Manifest Inheritance**

**Goal:** Instantiate the agent with MAPi Prime as its base.

1. **Inherit MAPi vX.Y**
    - Pull the current Prime manifest (Chunks 1–5).
    - Mark PG/RS as **Mandatory** or **Optional** for this agent.
2. **Apply Archetype Delta**
    - Add or override PG/RS codes specific to the archetype.
    - Remove any non‑applicable optional rules.
3. **Version Tagging**
    - Assign **Agent Manifest Version** (e.g., `AgentName-MAPi5.4.1`).
    - Log in policy change history (PG7.2).

### **Phase 2 — Configuration & Tool Binding**

**Goal:** Bind the agent to its operational environment and tools.

1. **Tool Whitelisting** (PG2.3, RS6.172)
    - Approve only the tools needed for the agent’s role.
    - For quantum‑capable agents, include PG‑Q3 and RS‑Q103.
2. **Schema & Context Anchors** (PG6.33, RS2.55)
    - Define persistent tokens for context continuity.
    - Set up RS6.171 (Agentic Persistence Priming).
3. **Boundary Signaling** (RS2.52, RS5.85)
    - Configure output formatting to separate internal vs. external logic.

### **Phase 3 — Metrics & Telemetry Activation**

**Goal:** Ensure measurement hooks are live before first run.

    - Include quantum scenarios if PG‑Q1 is active.
2. **Log Outcomes** (RS8.304)
    - Record deviations, corrective actions, and final pass/fail.
3. **Policy Adjustments** (RS7)
    - Inject or roll back rules as needed before go‑live.

### **Phase 5 — Deployment & Monitoring**

**Goal:** Move the agent into production with governance safeguards.

1. **Deploy Early** (RS6.188) in a representative environment.
2. **Monitor Metrics** daily/weekly/monthly per MAPi cadence.
3. **Escalate on Breach** (RS6.165, RS‑Q104) if thresholds are exceeded.

### **Phase 6 — Continuous Improvement**

**Goal:** Keep the agent aligned with MAPi and evolving needs.

1. **Periodic Drift Checks** (RS3.57).
2. **Scenario Re‑Runs** after any manifest or tool change.
3. **Meta‑Learning Updates** (RS6.150) from performance data.
4. **Version Increment** when PG/RS changes are made.

### **Workflow Output Artifacts**

- **Agent Manifest File** — MAPi Prime + Archetype Delta + Version Tag.
- **Tool Whitelist** — Approved tools with metadata.
- **Metrics Baseline Report** — Initial MT1–MT6 (and MT‑Q) values.
- **Scenario Validation Log** — RS8 results and corrective actions.

## **Chunk 7 — Metrics Dashboard Schema**

*Purpose:* Provide a standardized, MAPi‑compliant schema for capturing, storing, and visualizing agent performance metrics (MT1–MT6 and MT‑Q). This schema ensures consistent measurement, easy aggregation, and direct linkage to governance triggers (e.g., RS6.165 escalations, RS7 policy injections).*

### **Schema Overview**

- **Format:** Tabular (spreadsheet or database table)
- **Granularity:** One row per agent per measurement period (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Retention:** Minimum 12 months for trend analysis
- **Integration:** Directly referenced in Phase 3 of Chunk 6 (Metrics & Telemetry Activation)
- **Auditability:** All entries carry version tags for the agent’s manifest and MAPi Prime version

### **Core Fields**

### **Phase 1 — Baseline Compliance Simulation** (RS8.301)

**Goal:** Verify that the agent adheres to all mandatory PG/RS codes.

1. **Run Compliance Scenarios**
    - Test core governance behaviors: drift detection (PG1.2), assumption flagging (PG1.3), constraint signaling (PG4.1), escalation triggers (RS6.165).
2. **Log Violations**
    - Record any PG/RS breaches in the Scenario Outcome Log (RS8.304).
3. **Immediate Remediation**
    - Apply RS7 policy injections or rollbacks before proceeding.

### **Phase 3 — Regression Testing** (RS8.303)

**Goal:** Ensure no drift or degradation from prior validated behavior.

1. **Replay Known‑Good Scenarios**
    - Use outputs from earlier validated versions as baselines.
2. **Compare Outputs**
    - Flag deviations unless explicitly justified by updated PG/RS logic.

### **Phase 4 — Quantum Scenario Validation** *(Conditional)*

**Goal:** For agents with PG‑Q1 active, validate quantum safety and compliance.

1. **Runaway Simulation**
    - Trigger RS‑Q101 pre‑execution risk checks; verify escalation on unsafe conditions.
2. **PQC Breach Attempt**
    - Attempt to send sensitive data without PQC; RS‑Q103 must block.
3. **Output Drift Test**
    - Run identical quantum jobs multiple times; RS‑Q102 must flag instability.

### **Phase 5 — Metrics Capture & Analysis**

**Goal:** Populate the Chunk 7 schema with real data from the dry run.

1. **Record MT1–MT6** (and MT‑Q if applicable) for each scenario set.
2. **Threshold Evaluation**
    - Auto‑populate `Threshold_Breach` and `Breach_Details` fields.
3. **Escalation Logging**
    - Mark `Escalation_Triggered` if RS6.165 or RS‑Q104 fired.

### **Phase 6 — Go/No‑Go Decision**

**Goal:** Decide whether the agent is ready for production.

1. **Pass Criteria:**
    - No critical PG/RS violations.
    - All metrics within defined thresholds.
    - All escalations resolved or mitigated.
2. **Fail Criteria:**
    - Any unmitigated PG/RS breach.
    - Metrics exceeding thresholds without remediation.
    - Unresolved escalation events.

### **Phase 7 — Post‑Validation Actions**

**Goal:** Close the loop and prepare for deployment or re‑work.

1. **If Pass:**
    - Promote agent to production per Chunk 6 Phase 5.
    - Archive Scenario Outcome Log and Metrics Baseline Report.
2. **If Fail:**
    - Apply targeted RS7 policy changes.
    - Re‑run affected scenarios until pass criteria are met.

### **Output Artifacts**

Chunk 9 — Change Management & Version Control (v5.5)
Purpose: Ensure that all modifications to MAPi Prime and MAPi‑governed agents are deliberate, documented, validated, metrics‑instrumented, automatable, and reversible. This chunk provides the governance scaffolding for tracking, approving, and auditing changes, preventing silent drift and preserving operational integrity.

PG‑CM — Change Management Governance Heuristics
PG‑CM1 — Version tagging discipline: Require version tags for MAPi Prime and all agents; increment on any PG/RS change.

PG‑CM2 — Change log mandate: Maintain an immutable, chronological log of all changes.

PG‑CM3 — Validation before activation: Require RS8 scenario validation before any change goes live.

PG‑CM4 — Rollback preparedness: Ensure every change has a defined rollback path (RS7.203).

PG‑CM5 — Scope declaration: Declare whether a change is global (MAPi Prime), archetype‑specific, or agent‑specific.

PG‑CM6 — Metrics baseline shift: Capture pre‑ and post‑change metrics (Chunk 7 schema) for comparison.

PG‑CM7 — Auditability: All changes must be traceable to a Change Log entry with rationale and validation reference.

PG‑CM8 — Metrics‑integrated validation mandate: Validation must include Metrics_Before and Metrics_After capture, with threshold checks applied; changes with breaches cannot be activated.

PG‑CM9 — Automation traceability: Automated runs must produce atomic artifacts (outbox, change logs, scenario results, metrics) and create signed/timestamped commits and tags for recovery.

RS‑CM — Change Management Implementation Rules
RS‑CM100 — Change proposal logging: Create a draft Change Log entry before implementation.

RS‑CM101 — Impact analysis: Identify affected PG/RS codes, scenarios, and metrics.

RS‑CM102 — Validation execution: Run RS8 scenarios relevant to the change; log results.

RS‑CM103 — Approval workflow: Require governance authority sign‑off before activation.

RS‑CM104 — Version increment: Update manifest/agent version tags upon activation.

RS‑CM105 — Post‑change monitoring: Compare metrics pre/post change; flag regressions.

RS‑CM106 — Rollback execution: Revert to prior version if regressions or breaches occur.

RS‑CM107 — Change closure: Mark Change Log entry as closed once stable for defined period.

RS‑CM108 — Automated inbox state update: Upon decision, update the request status to completed/rejected in the active inbox file to prevent reprocessing.

RS‑CM109 — Threshold gate: If any metric exceeds its configured threshold, the change is rejected (or auto‑rolled‑back if already applied).

RS‑CM110 — Commit and tag: Persist artifacts via an atomic commit and tag: GOV-<Agent_ID>-validation-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>, referencing the processed Change_IDs.

Change Log Schema
(semicolon‑delimited CSV; one for MAPi Prime, one per agent)

Change_ID — Unique change reference (e.g., CHG‑2025‑09‑04‑01)

Date — ISO timestamp of decision or activation

Changed_By — Person/system making the change (e.g., GOV‑2)

Scope — MAPi_Prime or Agent:<Name>

Old_Version — Version before change

New_Version — Version after change

Change_Type — Add | Modify | Remove

Affected_PG_RS — Pipe‑delimited codes (e.g., PG6.30|RS6.161)

Reason — Why the change was made

Validation_Ref — Path to scenario_results.csv and/or validation report

Rollback_Ref — Linked rollback change ID (if any)

Metrics_Before — Pipe‑delimited metric:value pairs (e.g., MT1=1.8%|MT2=3.2%)

Metrics_After — Pipe‑delimited metric:value pairs

Status — Draft | Active | Rolled Back | Closed | Rejected

Constraints:

Metrics_Before and Metrics_After are required for any entry that triggers RS‑CM102.

Validation_Ref must be a resolvable repo path.

Status must reflect final state post‑monitoring; Rejected if RS‑CM109 blocks activation.

Governance Flow
Propose change — RS‑CM100; log draft entry.

Impact analysis — RS‑CM101; identify PG/RS, scenarios, metrics affected.

Validate — RS‑CM102; run RS8 scenarios; instrument metrics (PG‑CM8).

Threshold gate — RS‑CM109; reject if any metric breaches thresholds.

Approve & apply — RS‑CM103; then RS‑CM104 version increment.

Post‑change monitoring — RS‑CM105; confirm no regressions.

Commit & tag — RS‑CM110; atomic artifacts commit + tag.

Inbox update — RS‑CM108; mark request completed/rejected.

Close — RS‑CM107; mark Closed after stability period or Rejected if blocked.

Integration Notes
MAPi Prime changes: Affect all agents unless scoped; require broader RS8 regression coverage.

Agent‑specific changes: Target only relevant RS8 scenarios per role/archetype.

Quantum‑enabled agents: Re‑run Chunk 5 scenarios if PG‑Q/RS‑Q touched.

Metrics linkage: Dashboard (Chunk 7) updates are mandatory; thresholds from /Config/thresholds.csv govern RS‑CM109.



## **Chunk 10 — Governance Roles & Responsibilities**

*Purpose:* Define the human and system roles responsible for maintaining MAPi Prime and its derived agents. This ensures that every governance action — from proposing a change to closing it — has a clear owner, authority level, and accountability trail.*

### **Role Definitions**

| Role Code | Role Name | Core Responsibilities | Authority Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GOV‑1 | **Governance Authority** | Owns MAPi Prime; approves/rejects all global PG/RS changes; arbitrates conflicts; signs off on Go/No‑Go decisions for major releases. | Full — can approve global manifest changes and agent‑level exceptions. |
| GOV‑2 | **Change Manager** | Maintains Change Logs (Chunk 9); ensures PG‑CM and RS‑CM compliance; coordinates validation and rollback readiness. | High — can approve agent‑level changes; recommends global changes to GOV‑1. |
| GOV‑3 | **Validation Lead** | Designs and executes RS8 scenario validations; ensures test coverage for proposed changes; signs off on validation results. | Medium — can block activation until validation passes. |
| GOV‑4 | **Metrics Steward** | Owns the Metrics Dashboard (Chunk 7); monitors MT1–MT6 (and MT‑Q); flags threshold breaches; triggers RS6.165 escalations. | Medium — can recommend policy changes based on metrics trends. |
| GOV‑5 | **Agent Owner** | Defines agent purpose, scope, and archetype; initiates change requests; ensures agent stays within PG/RS boundaries. | Medium — can propose and implement changes within approved scope. |
| GOV‑6 | **Security & Ethics Officer** | Reviews all changes for compliance with PG6.32 (Assumption Debugging), PG‑Q4 (Ethical Boundaries), and data/model security mandates. | High — can veto changes on security/ethics grounds. |
| GOV‑7 | **Quantum Oversight Lead** *(conditional)* | Oversees PG‑Q/RS‑Q compliance; validates quantum scenario runs; monitors MT‑Q metrics. | Medium — can block quantum‑related changes until safe. |

### **Governance Workflow Mapping**

| Change Management Step (Chunk 9) | Primary Role | Supporting Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RS‑CM100 — Change Proposal Logging | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |
| RS‑CM101 — Impact Analysis | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Validation Lead (GOV‑3), Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6) |
| RS‑CM102 — Validation Execution | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) | Agent Owner (GOV‑5), Quantum Oversight Lead (GOV‑7) |
| RS‑CM103 — Approval Workflow | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) | Change Manager (GOV‑2), Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6) |
| RS‑CM104 — Version Increment | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) |
| RS‑CM105 — Post‑Change Monitoring | Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) |
| RS‑CM106 — Rollback Execution | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |
| RS‑CM107 — Change Closure | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |

### **Escalation Protocol**

- **Technical Breach:** Metrics Steward → Change Manager → Governance Authority.
- **Ethics/Security Breach:** Security & Ethics Officer → Governance Authority (immediate).
- **Quantum Runaway Risk:** Quantum Oversight Lead → Governance Authority (immediate).

### **Integration Notes**

- Roles can be held by individuals or teams, but authority level must be explicit.
- For solo‑founder contexts, one person may hold multiple roles — but must still follow the workflow gates.
- All role actions must be logged in the Change Log (Chunk 9) with timestamps and signatures.


Chunk 11 — Governance Rituals & Cadence (v5.5)
Purpose: Establish recurring governance activities, their frequency, and their responsible roles (from Chunk 10) to ensure MAPi Prime and its agents remain aligned with governance mandates, performance thresholds, and evolving operational needs. All rituals must be metrics‑instrumented, scenario‑linked, and produce automation‑ready artifacts.

GR‑1 — Daily Rituals
Ritual Code	Name	Description	Primary Role(s)

GR‑5.3	Legacy Handoff Drill	Simulate transfer of MAPi governance to a new steward; verify documentation sufficiency; log in /Validation_Reports/.	Governance Authority (GOV‑1)
Integration Notes (v5.5 Enhancements)
Automation‑Ready: All rituals must be executable via the validation runner; manual runs must follow the same artifact structure.

Metrics Instrumentation: Every ritual that touches performance or compliance must log Metrics_Before and Metrics_After, with deltas and threshold checks.

Artifact Commit & Tag: Ritual outputs are committed atomically with a tag: RITUAL-<Code>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.

Cross‑Linking: Ritual artifacts must reference related Change Log entries, scenario results, and metrics snapshots.

Missed Rituals: Must be logged with reason and rescheduled; automation can flag overdue rituals.

Cadence Adjustments: High‑risk agents may require intensified daily/weekly checks; automation config should support cadence overrides.



## **Chunk 12 — Governance Repository Structure**

*Purpose:* Provide a standardized, version‑controlled repository for all MAPi Prime and agent‑level governance artifacts. This ensures that every manifest, change log, metric set, and validation result is stored in a consistent, retrievable, and auditable format.*

### **GRS‑1 — Repository Principles**

| Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GRS‑1.1 | Single Source of Truth | All governance artifacts must reside in the repository; no shadow copies. |
| GRS‑1.2 | Version Control | Every artifact is versioned; changes are tracked with diffs and metadata. |
| GRS‑1.3 | Immutable History | Past versions are never overwritten; corrections create new entries. |
| GRS‑1.4 | Indexed Retrieval | Artifacts are indexed by Agent ID, Manifest Version, Date, and Artifact Type. |
| GRS‑1.5 | Access Control | Role‑based permissions (Chunk 10) govern read/write/delete rights. |
| GRS‑1.6 | Audit Logging | All access and modifications are logged with timestamps and user IDs. |

### **GRS‑2 — Repository Structure**

**Top‑Level Folders:**

- **Chunk 9 Change Management** → auto‑writes to `/Change_Logs`.
- **Chunk 11 Governance Rituals** → auto‑writes to `/Governance_Ritual_Reports`.

## **Chunk 13 — Incident Response Protocol**

*Purpose:* Provide a structured, time‑bound process for responding to incidents that threaten governance compliance, security, ethical boundaries, or operational stability in MAPi Prime or its agents. This ensures rapid containment, root‑cause analysis, and systemic prevention of recurrence.*

### **IR‑1 — Incident Categories**

| Code | Category | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IR‑1.1 | Governance Breach | Violation of PG/RS mandates. | Ignoring PG1.2 drift detection; bypassing RS6.165 escalation. |
| IR‑1.2 | Security Incident | Compromise or attempted compromise of sensitive data, tools, or models. | PQC bypass attempt; credential exposure. |
| IR‑1.3 | Ethical Violation | Breach of PG6.32 or PG‑Q4 ethical boundaries. | Use of agent for prohibited tasks. |
| IR‑1.4 | Catastrophic Drift | Rapid, systemic deviation from intended behavior. | Agent outputs consistently off‑scope within hours. |
| IR‑1.5 | Quantum Runaway *(conditional)* | Uncontrolled escalation of quantum‑enabled capabilities. | RS‑Q101 risk check bypassed; unsafe quantum job executed. |

### **IR‑2 — Detection & Reporting**

| Step | Action | Responsible Role(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Automated Detection — Metrics breach (Chunk 7) or RS8 scenario failure triggers incident flag. | Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) |
| 2 | Manual Reporting — Any role can log an incident via the Governance Repository (Chunk 12). | All |
| 3 | Initial Classification — Assign IR‑1 category and severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical). | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |

### **IR‑3 — Containment**

| Step | Action | Responsible Role(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Isolate Agent — Suspend affected agent or disable risky PG/RS modules. | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |
| 2 | Secure Data — Lock down affected data sources/tools; revoke credentials if needed. | Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6) |
| 3 | Activate Kill Switch *(if quantum)* — Trigger PG‑Q2 + RS‑Q101/RS‑Q104 kill path. | Quantum Oversight Lead (GOV‑7) |

### **IR‑4 — Investigation**

| Step | Action | Responsible Role(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Root Cause Analysis — Trace incident to specific PG/RS, tool, or external factor. | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) |
| 2 | Impact Assessment — Quantify affected outputs, users, and downstream systems. | Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) |
| 3 | Evidence Preservation — Archive logs, metrics, and scenario results in Governance Repository. | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |

### **IR‑5 — Resolution**

| Step | Action | Responsible Role(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Apply Fix — Modify PG/RS, patch tools, or adjust workflows. | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) |
| 2 | Validate Fix — Run targeted RS8 scenarios to confirm resolution. | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) |
| 3 | Resume Operations — Restore agent to active state if safe. | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |

### **IR‑6 — Post‑Incident Review**

| Step | Action | Responsible Role(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Lessons Learned — Document findings, contributing factors, and prevention measures. | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |
| 2 | Policy Update — Inject new PG/RS or adjust thresholds as needed (RS7). | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |
| 3 | Metrics Baseline Reset — Establish new baseline in Chunk 7 schema. | Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) |

### **IR‑7 — Time Targets**

| Severity | Containment | Investigation | Resolution | Review |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 24h | 3 days | 5 days | 7 days |
| Medium | 12h | 2 days | 3 days | 5 days |
| High | 4h | 24h | 48h | 72h |
| Critical | Immediate | 12h | 24h | 48h |

### **Integration Notes**

- **Repository Hooks:** All IR steps produce artifacts stored in `/Incidents` within the Governance Repository (Chunk 12).
- **Scenario Linkage:** Every incident must be tied to at least one RS8 scenario for validation and regression prevention.
- **Quantum‑Specific:** If PG‑Q1 is active, IR‑1.5 incidents require Quantum Oversight Lead sign‑off before closure.
- **Change Management Link:** All fixes flow through Chunk 9’s Change Log and version increment process.

## **Chunk 14 — Business Continuity & Fallback Operations**

*Purpose:* Define the strategies, triggers, and operational patterns for maintaining essential services when MAPi‑governed agents or MAPi Prime itself are unavailable or impaired. This chunk ensures continuity of operations, controlled degradation, and rapid restoration without compromising governance integrity.*

### **BC‑1 — Continuity Principles**

| Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BC‑1.1 | Governance First | Continuity measures must still respect PG/RS mandates — no bypassing governance for speed. |
| BC‑1.2 | Controlled Degradation | Reduce scope or autonomy rather than halting entirely, where safe. |
| BC‑1.3 | Pre‑Approved Fallbacks | All fallback agents, tools, and workflows must be pre‑validated and documented. |
| BC‑1.4 | Minimal Viable Service (MVS) | Define the smallest functional set of capabilities to maintain during disruption. |
| BC‑1.5 | Rapid Recovery | Prioritize restoration of full governance‑compliant operations. |

### **BC‑2 — Fallback Triggers**

| Trigger Code | Description | Detection Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FT‑2.1 | Agent Offline | Agent fails health checks or stops responding. |
| FT‑2.2 | Governance Containment | Agent suspended due to IR‑3 containment. |
| FT‑2.3 | MAPi Prime Unavailable | Core manifest repository inaccessible. |
| FT‑2.4 | Tool Failure | Critical whitelisted tool unavailable or compromised. |
| FT‑2.5 | Quantum Kill Switch | PG‑Q2/RS‑Q101 triggered for safety. |

### **BC‑3 — Fallback Strategies**

| Strategy Code | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FS‑3.1 | Role Downgrade | Switch to a reduced‑autonomy archetype with fewer capabilities. | Compliance Auditor → Passive Monitor |
| FS‑3.2 | Agent Substitution | Swap in a pre‑validated backup agent with same PG/RS profile. | OpsComplianceBot‑B |
| FS‑3.3 | Manual Override | Temporarily hand off tasks to human operators. | Governance Authority takes over approvals. |
| FS‑3.4 | Tool Substitution | Replace failed tool with pre‑approved alternative. | Swap API endpoint for backup service. |
| FS‑3.5 | Offline Mode | Operate in a disconnected state using cached manifests and local tools. | Local MAPi manifest copy with limited RS8 scenarios. |

### **BC‑4 — Pre‑Validation Requirements**

- All fallback agents must pass RS8 baseline scenarios before being designated as backups.
- Fallback tools must be whitelisted (PG2.3) and documented in the Governance Repository (Chunk 12).
- Offline manifests must be checksum‑verified against last known‑good MAPi Prime version.

### **BC‑5 — Continuity Execution Flow**

1. **Trigger Detection** — Metrics breach, health check failure, or IR containment event.
2. **Fallback Activation** — Switch to pre‑approved strategy (BC‑3).
3. **Governance Check** — Ensure fallback still meets PG/RS compliance.
4. **Service Continuation** — Operate in fallback mode until restoration.
5. **Recovery & Restoration** — Return to primary agent or MAPi Prime; log transition in Change Log (Chunk 9).

### **BC‑6 — Roles & Responsibilities**

| Step | Primary Role | Supporting Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger Detection | Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) |
| Fallback Activation | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |
| Governance Check | Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6) | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) |
| Recovery & Restoration | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |

### **BC‑7 — Testing & Drills**

- **Quarterly Continuity Drill** — Simulate FT‑2.1 and FT‑2.3 triggers; validate FS‑3.1–FS‑3.5 execution.
- **Annual Full‑Scale Test** — Simulate MAPi Prime outage; run all fallback strategies in sequence.
- **Post‑Drill Review** — Log results in Governance Repository; update fallback plans as needed.

### **Integration Notes**

- Links directly to Chunk 13 (Incident Response) for containment triggers.
- Uses Chunk 12 repository for fallback asset storage and retrieval.
- Requires Chunk 9 change logging for all fallback activations and restorations.
- Metrics from fallback mode feed into Chunk 7 dashboard for performance comparison.

## **Chunk 15 — Decommissioning & Retirement Protocol**

*Purpose:* Provide a controlled, auditable process for retiring MAPi‑governed agents, archetypes, or MAPi Prime versions. This ensures that decommissioning does not break dependencies, lose governance history, or leave security gaps.*

### **DC‑1 — Retirement Principles**

| Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DC‑1.1 | Governance Preservation | All PG/RS, metrics, and scenario results must be archived before retirement. |
| DC‑1.2 | Dependency Awareness | Identify and resolve any systems, agents, or workflows dependent on the retiring entity. |
| DC‑1.3 | Security Closure | Revoke all credentials, API keys, and tool access associated with the retiring entity. |
| DC‑1.4 | Immutable History | Preserve the full manifest, change log, and metrics in the Governance Repository (Chunk 12). |
| DC‑1.5 | Controlled Handoff | If functions are to be replaced, ensure successor agents are validated before cutover. |

### **DC‑2 — Retirement Triggers**

| Trigger Code | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RT‑2.1 | End of Lifecycle | Agent or MAPi version superseded by newer release. |
| RT‑2.2 | Obsolescence | Archetype or agent no longer meets operational needs. |
| RT‑2.3 | Security/Ethics Breach | Permanent removal due to irreparable governance violation. |
| RT‑2.4 | Strategic Shift | Change in organizational priorities. |

### **DC‑3 — Retirement Workflow**

1. **Initiation**
    - Agent Owner (GOV‑5) or Governance Authority (GOV‑1) proposes retirement.
    - Log proposal in Change Log (Chunk 9) with `Change_Type=Retire`.
2. **Dependency Mapping**
    - Change Manager (GOV‑2) identifies all dependent agents, tools, and workflows.
    - Document in Governance Repository.
3. **Successor Planning** *(if applicable)*
    - Identify replacement agent/archetype.
    - Validate via Chunk 6 (Agent Creation Workflow) and Chunk 8 (Scenario Validation).
4. **Archival**
    - Archive manifest, change logs, metrics, and scenario results in `/Archive` folder of Governance Repository (Chunk 12).
    - Apply checksum verification.
5. **Security Closure**
    - Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6) revokes all credentials and tool access.
    - Confirm via audit log.
6. **Cutover** *(if successor exists)*
    - Switch dependencies to successor agent.
    - Run post‑cutover validation scenarios.
7. **Final Decommission**
    - Mark retired entity as `Inactive` in repository index.
    - Close Change Log entry with final status.

### **DC‑4 — Roles & Responsibilities**

| Step | Primary Role | Supporting Roles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initiation | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |
| Dependency Mapping | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) |
| Successor Planning | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) |
| Archival | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) |
| Security Closure | Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6) | Change Manager (GOV‑2) |
| Cutover | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) |
| Final Decommission | Change Manager (GOV‑2) | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) |

### **DC‑5 — Validation & Sign‑Off**

- **Mandatory:** RS8 regression scenarios must be run on any successor before cutover.
- **Sign‑Off Order:** Validation Lead → Security & Ethics Officer → Governance Authority.
- **Final Artifact:** Decommissioning Report stored in `/Decommissioning` folder of Governance Repository.

### **Integration Notes**

- Links to Chunk 9 (Change Management) for logging and version closure.
- Uses Chunk 12 (Governance Repository) for archival and indexing.
- May trigger Chunk 14 (Business Continuity) if retirement is unplanned or due to incident.

## **Chunk 16 — Archetype Lifecycle Management**

*Purpose:* Define how archetypes are created, evolved, versioned, and retired within MAPi. Archetypes are the “genetic code” for agents — they determine default PG/RS toggles, reasoning styles, tool bindings, and operational boundaries. This chunk ensures archetypes remain relevant, compliant, and inheritance‑safe.*

### **AL‑1 — Archetype Principles**

| Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AL‑1.1 | Governance Parity | Archetypes follow the same PG/RS compliance rules as agents. |
| AL‑1.2 | Versioned Evolution | Every archetype change increments its version and is logged (Chunk 9). |
| AL‑1.3 | Scenario‑Backed Validation | Archetypes must pass RS8 scenarios before being used to spawn agents. |
| AL‑1.4 | Dependency Awareness | Track which agents inherit from each archetype. |
| AL‑1.5 | Retirement Discipline | Retire archetypes via a controlled process (Chunk 15‑style). |

### **AL‑2 — Archetype Creation Workflow**

1. **Purpose Definition**
    - Governance Authority (GOV‑1) and Agent Owner (GOV‑5) define the archetype’s role, scope, and constraints.
2. **PG/RS Profile Assembly**
    - Select mandatory and optional PG/RS codes for the archetype’s default manifest.
    - Include reasoning patterns, tool bindings, and hygiene layers.
3. **Version Tagging**
    - Assign `ArchetypeName‑vX.Y` and log in Archetype Change Log.
4. **Scenario Validation**
    - Run RS8 baseline scenarios to confirm compliance and performance.
5. **Approval & Activation**
    - Governance Authority signs off; archetype becomes available for agent creation (Chunk 6).

### **AL‑3 — Archetype Evolution**

| Step | Action | Responsible Role(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Propose Change | Agent Owner (GOV‑5) or Metrics Steward (GOV‑4) based on performance data. |
| 2 | Impact Analysis | Change Manager (GOV‑2) — identify affected agents and dependencies. |
| 3 | Validation | Validation Lead (GOV‑3) — run RS8 scenarios. |
| 4 | Approval | Governance Authority (GOV‑1) — sign‑off. |
| 5 | Version Increment | Change Manager (GOV‑2) — update version and Change Log. |
| 6 | Agent Sync | Notify all agents inheriting from the archetype; run regression tests. |

### **AL‑4 — Archetype Retirement**

- Follows **Chunk 15** workflow with these additions:
    - **Successor Archetype Planning:** Identify replacement archetype for dependent agents.
    - **Agent Migration:** Re‑instantiate agents under successor archetype manifest; validate via RS8.
    - **Dependency Closure:** Update all references in Governance Repository (Chunk 12).

### **AL‑5 — Archetype Change Log Schema**

*(Stored in* `/Archetypes/Change_Logs` *in Governance Repository)*

### **Integration Notes**

- Archetype lifecycle hooks into:
    - **Chunk 6** (Agent Creation Workflow) — archetype selection.
    - **Chunk 7** (Metrics Dashboard) — archetype‑level performance tracking.
    - **Chunk 8** (Scenario Validation) — baseline and regression testing.
    - **Chunk 9** (Change Management) — version control and rollback.
    - **Chunk 15** (Retirement Protocol) — controlled decommissioning.

Chunk 17 — Archetype Performance Benchmarking (v5.5)
Purpose: Establish a standardized, metrics‑driven, automation‑ready process for evaluating archetype effectiveness over time. This ensures that archetype evolution (Chunk 16) is informed by evidence, not guesswork, and that underperforming templates are improved or retired. All benchmarking must be metrics‑instrumented, scenario‑linked, and produce atomic, cross‑linked artifacts.

APB‑1 — Benchmarking Principles
Code	Name	Purpose
APB‑1.1	Comparative Measurement	Benchmark archetypes against each other using identical metrics and scenarios.
APB‑1.2	Longitudinal Tracking	Measure performance trends over time, not just snapshots; store historical runs for trend analysis.
APB‑1.3	Scenario Consistency	Use the same RS8 scenario sets for all archetypes in a given category; scenario definitions stored in /MAPi_Prime/Scenario_Library/.
APB‑1.4	Governance Weighting	Weight metrics according to governance priorities (e.g., drift rate > latency).
APB‑1.5	Evidence‑Driven Evolution	Use benchmark data to drive Chunk 16 archetype changes or retirements.
APB‑1.6	Automation Traceability	All benchmark runs must be executable via the validation runner, producing commit‑tagged artifacts.
APB‑2 — Benchmarking Metrics
(Extends Chunk 7 schema with archetype‑level aggregation; all values are Metrics_Before/Metrics_After aware)

Metric Code	Name	Description	Example
APB‑MT1	Avg. Drift Rate	Mean MT1 across all agents of the archetype.	1.4%
APB‑MT2	Avg. Error Rate	Mean MT2 across all agents.	2.8%
APB‑MT3	Iteration Efficiency	Mean MT3 across all agents.	2.3
APB‑MT4	Escalation Frequency	Mean MT4 across all agents.	0.9%
APB‑MT5	Tool Reliability Score	Mean MT5 across all agents.	97.1%
APB‑MT6	Response Latency	Mean MT6 across all agents.	4.5s
APB‑MTQ1–3	Quantum Metrics	Mean MT‑Q values for quantum‑enabled archetypes.	MTQ3=100%
APB‑ΔMT*	Metric Delta	Change in metric value since last benchmark run.	MT1: –0.1%
APB‑3 — Benchmarking Process
Data Collection

Pull MT1–MT6 (and MT‑Q if applicable) from all agents inheriting the archetype.

Capture Metrics_Before snapshot.

Aggregate into archetype‑level metrics.

Scenario Validation Runs

Execute RS8 baseline scenarios for each archetype quarterly.

Capture Metrics_After snapshot immediately post‑run.

Record pass/fail rates, deviations, and metric deltas.

Weighting & Scoring

Apply governance weighting factors (APB‑1.4).

Produce a composite Archetype Performance Score (APS).

Flag any metric breaches per /Config/thresholds.csv (threshold gate).

Ranking & Comparison

Rank archetypes within their category (e.g., compliance, research, orchestration).

Identify top and bottom performers.

Action Triggers

APS ≥ 90: Candidate for best‑practice template.

APS 70–89: Monitor; minor tuning if trends decline.

APS < 70: Trigger Chunk 16 evolution or retirement workflow.

APB‑4 — Reporting Cadence
Frequency	Report Type	Audience
Quarterly	Archetype Benchmark Report (automation‑generated)	Governance Authority, Change Manager, Validation Lead
Annually	Archetype Portfolio Review (links to GR‑4.1 in Chunk 11)	Full governance team
APB‑5 — Roles & Responsibilities
Step	Primary Role	Supporting Roles
Data Collection	Metrics Steward (GOV‑4)	Agent Owners (GOV‑5)
Scenario Validation	Validation Lead (GOV‑3)	Change Manager (GOV‑2)
Weighting & Scoring	Governance Authority (GOV‑1)	Metrics Steward (GOV‑4)
Action Decisions	Governance Authority (GOV‑1)	Change Manager (GOV‑2), Security & Ethics Officer (GOV‑6)
Integration Notes (v5.5 Enhancements)
Automation‑Ready: Benchmarking can be run via the validation runner with archetype‑level config.

Metrics Instrumentation: All runs capture before/after metrics and compute deltas; breaches trigger RS‑CM109.

Artifact Commit & Tag: Benchmark outputs committed atomically with tag: APB-<Archetype>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.

Cross‑Linking: Reports reference source metrics, scenario results, and related Change Log entries.

Storage: All benchmark reports stored in /Archetypes/Benchmark_Reports in the governance repository (Chunk 12).

Feeds: Directly informs Chunk 16 (Archetype Lifecycle Management) and links to Chunk 11 (Governance Rituals) for quarterly/annual reviews.
