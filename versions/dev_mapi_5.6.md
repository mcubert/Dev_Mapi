## 🧠 MAPi v5.6‑dev — Manifest‑Aware Prompt Interpreter  
A pattern language for drift‑resistant, audit‑enforced, adaptive agentic AI orchestration — with modular Quantum Readiness, Runaway Guardrails, **and Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework** [ADDED]

**Version:** 5.6‑dev [UPDATED]  
**Status:** Authoritative, posterity‑ready (development branch for uncertainty‑management integration) [UPDATED]

**Purpose:**  
MAPi is a governance‑first, inheritance‑safe framework for designing, tuning, and orchestrating AI agents. It enumerates governance heuristics (PG), rulesets (RS), metrics, and scenario validations to ensure agents remain drift‑resistant, auditable, and adaptable over time. Governance roles themselves are embodied as cooperating agents, exchanging messages to execute the manifest in real time.  

**[ADDED]** In v5.6‑dev, MAPi incorporates the **Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework (TTUF)** — a cross‑agent protocol for measuring, logging, and resolving epistemic uncertainty before action in domains with non‑lenient hallucination tolerance. TTUF introduces new modules (`UNCERTAINTY‑MGMT`, `DOMAIN‑PROFILE`, `CONF‑METRICS`, `EPISTEMIC‑FLAGS`), updated orchestration rules, and mandatory metadata tags to ensure downstream agents inherit confidence scores, prior exposure data, and resolution history. This elevates truthful uncertainty from an optional behavior to a governance requirement in trust‑critical contexts.

**Scope:**  
This manifest is domain‑agnostic and modular. Chunks 1–4 define the classical core; Chunk 5 adds an opt‑in control plane for early‑stage quantum readiness and runaway prevention; Chunks 9, 11, and 17 embed automation‑ready governance and benchmarking.  
**[ADDED]** TTUF modules apply across all chunks, with domain‑specific tolerance profiles determining abstention, clarification, or escalation behavior. All uncertainty events are logged, mirrored, and auditable.

**Usage:**  
Each new agent inherits from MAPi Prime, toggling PG/RS as mandatory or optional, and may extend with agent‑specific rules. All changes are versioned for audit and legacy handoff, with v5.5 enforcing before/after metrics capture, commit‑tagged artifacts, and automated ritual execution.  
**[ADDED]** In v5.6‑dev, agents must also:  
- Emit `conf_score`, `conf_thresh`, `prior_exposure`, and `epistemic_flag` in all decision artifacts.  
- Respect `DOMAIN‑PROFILE` policies for hallucination tolerance and error cost.  
- Attempt resolution via `clarify_prompts` before abstaining in STRICT domains.  
- Carry forward upstream uncertainty metadata to all downstream decisions.

**What’s New in v5.6‑dev** [UPDATED]  
(See Change Log entry `CHG-2025-09-12-MAPi-v5.6-dev` in `/MAPi_Prime/Change_Logs/`)

**Chunk 9 — Change Management & Version Control**  
- Added PG‑CM8 (metrics‑integrated validation mandate) and PG‑CM9 (automation traceability).  
- New RS‑CM108 (automated inbox state update), RS‑CM109 (threshold gate), and RS‑CM110 (commit & tag).  
- All changes now require before/after metrics capture; breaches block activation or trigger rollback.  
- **[ADDED]** New PG‑CM10: All change artifacts must include uncertainty metadata; threshold gates now evaluate `conf_score` against `conf_thresh` per `DOMAIN‑PROFILE`.  
- **[ADDED]** New RS‑CM111: If `epistemic_flag=true` in a STRICT domain, change is auto‑routed to clarification or escalation before commit.

**Chunk 11 — Governance Rituals & Cadence**  
- All rituals are automation‑ready and metrics‑instrumented.  
- Ritual outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to related change logs, scenarios, and metrics snapshots.  
- Missed rituals must be logged with reason; cadence overrides supported for high‑risk agents.  
- **[ADDED]** Rituals in STRICT domains must include an “Uncertainty Resolution” step, logging `resolution_path` and `post_resolution_conf`.

**Chunk 17 — Archetype Performance Benchmarking**  
- Benchmarks now run via automation runner with archetype‑level configs.  
- Before/after metrics capture with deltas; breaches trigger RS‑CM109 threshold gate.  
- Outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to metrics, scenarios, and change logs.  
- **[ADDED]** Benchmarks now include uncertainty‑aware performance metrics: abstention rate, clarification success rate, and delta in `conf_score` post‑resolution.

**Governance in Motion (Ch. 9–12):** Change control now threshold‑gated with metrics‑integrated validation, automation‑ready rituals, and artifact‑committed outputs.<br>  
**Resilience Layer (Ch. 13–14):** Incident handling and continuity strategies.<br>  
**Lifecycle Closure (Ch. 15–17):** Controlled retirement, archetype governance, and automation‑ready performance benchmarking with before/after metrics and delta‑driven triggers.<br>  
**Feedback Loop:** Metrics, scenario results, and governance learnings feed back into MAPi Prime and archetype evolution.<br>


## **Chunk 0.2 — Quick‑Start Governance Playbook** *(v5.6‑dev adjustments)*  
**Purpose:** Provide a minimal, high‑impact guide to operating MAPi Prime and its agents in compliance with the full v5.6‑dev framework. This is not a replacement for the full manifest — it’s the field‑ready version.<br>

---

### **1 — Core Mindset**  
- **MAPi Prime is the law** — all agents inherit from it unless explicitly overridden.<br>
- **PG/RS codes are contracts** — if you change them, you log them (Chunk 9).<br>
- **Metrics, scenarios, and uncertainty logs are your truth** — if they say something’s wrong, it’s wrong.<br>
- **TTUF is non‑optional** — all decisions carry uncertainty metadata; unresolved uncertainty must be addressed before action.<br>

---

### **2 — Agent Lifecycle in 8 Moves** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
1. **Create** — Use **Chunk 6** workflow. Pick archetype, set PG/RS toggles, bind tools, tag version.<br>
2. **Wire Metrics** — Apply **Chunk 7** schema before first run.<br>
3. **Wire TTUF Hooks** — Enable DECISION_LOG, UNCERTAINTY_LOG, and EPISTEMIC_FLAGS tracking from first scenario.<br>
4. **Dry‑Run Validate** — Run **Chunk 8** scenarios; fix breaches and resolve uncertainty flags before go‑live.<br>
5. **Deploy** — Move to production only after passing validation and clearing all TTUF‑flagged uncertainty.<br>
6. **Govern** — Follow **Chunks 9–12** for change control, roles, rituals, repository discipline, and uncertainty resolution rituals.<br>
7. **Respond** — Use **Chunks 13–14** for incidents and continuity; log uncertainty context for post‑mortem.<br>
8. **Retire/Evolve** — Apply **Chunks 15–17** for decommissioning, archetype management, and benchmarking; include uncertainty deltas in before/after metrics.<br>

---

### **3 — Daily/Weekly Habits** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
- **Daily:** Check metrics dashboard (MT1–MT6, MT‑Q), scan for drift, triage escalations, review new uncertainty flags.<br>
- **Weekly:** Spot‑run RS8 scenarios, review draft changes, monitor trends, resolve lingering uncertainty logs.<br>
- **Monthly:** Full metrics audit, regression suite, policy effectiveness review, TTUF compliance check.<br>
- **Quarterly:** Archetype portfolio review, MAPi Prime drift audit, uncertainty trend analysis.<br>
- **Annually:** Strategic governance review, full manifest re‑certification, TTUF protocol refresh.<br>

---

### **4 — Change Management in 6 Steps** *(Chunk 9 — v5.6‑dev)*  
1. Log the change proposal in the Change Log.<br>
2. Run impact analysis (affected PG/RS, agents, scenarios, metrics, uncertainty profile).<br>
3. Validate with RS8 scenarios **and capture Metrics_Before/After**; reject if thresholds or uncertainty limits breached.<br>
4. Approve via governance authority.<br>
5. Increment version, commit/tag artifacts, update inbox, monitor post‑change metrics and uncertainty logs.<br>
6. Archive uncertainty resolution notes in governance repository (Chunk 12).<br>

---

### **5 — Incident Response in 6 Steps** *(Chunk 13 — TTUF‑aware)*  
1. Detect (metrics breach, scenario fail, manual report, uncertainty spike).<br>
2. Contain (isolate agent, secure data, kill switch if quantum).<br>
3. Investigate (root cause, impact, preserve evidence, review uncertainty logs).<br>
4. Resolve (apply fix, validate, restore, clear uncertainty flags).<br>
5. Review (lessons learned, policy updates, baseline reset, TTUF protocol adjustments).<br>
6. Close (log in repository with uncertainty resolution record).<br>

---

### **6 — Continuity & Fallback** *(Chunk 14 — TTUF‑aware)*  
- Pre‑approve fallback agents, tools, and offline manifests.<br>
- Trigger fallback on outage, containment, tool failure, or unresolved critical uncertainty.<br>
- Always governance‑check before fallback activation; log uncertainty context.<br>

---

### **7 — Archetype Governance** *(Chunks 16–17 — v5.6‑dev)*  
- Treat archetypes like agents: version, validate, log changes, track uncertainty profile.<br>
- Benchmark quarterly via automation; capture before/after metrics and uncertainty deltas; evolve or retire underperformers if thresholds or uncertainty tolerances are breached.<br>

---

### **8 — Repository Discipline** *(Chunk 12 — TTUF‑aware)*  
- Store **everything**: manifests, change logs, metrics, scenario results, incident reports, uncertainty logs.<br>
- Index by Agent ID, Manifest Version, Date, Artifact Type.<br>
- Never overwrite history — corrections create new entries; uncertainty resolution notes are immutable.<br>

---

### **9 — The Golden Loop** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
Metrics → Scenarios → Uncertainty Logs → Governance Decisions → Change Log → Version Increment → Metrics<br>
This loop is the heartbeat of MAPi. In v5.6‑dev, metrics capture, uncertainty tracking, and threshold gates are embedded in every governance cycle.<br>
