# MAPi 5.6 External Integration Matrix — Intent Anchor

This matrix consolidates all external context reviewed — Azure Baseline, Agentic AI Patterns (Parts 1–6), IBM architectures, Product Compass (Parts 1–2), and the composite “Hierarchy + Loop + Parallel + Shared RAG” pattern — into a single blueprint for adaptation.  
It preserves MAPi’s governance DNA while absorbing the best of these external models.

## Key Adaptation Moves

1. **Codify every external pattern/topology** as a PG/RS family with TTUF cause‑codes, CONF‑metric targets, and escalation rules.  
2. **Embed architecture selection** (from Product Compass) into Chunk 6.1 so every new agent request is routed through the right governance path.  
3. **Expand TTUF coverage** to multi‑agent uncertainty aggregation, leadership transitions, shared RAG events, loop iteration outcomes, and parallel synthesis.  
4. **Automate low‑risk lanes** — GOV‑role gates only for safety, security, critical ops, or intent/actual divergence.  
5. **Instrument shared knowledge** — all RAG retrievals/updates logged with uncertainty metadata.


# MAPi 5.6 Structural Adaptation Plan

This plan describes how MAPi 5.6 will evolve to integrate the external architectures, patterns, and frameworks captured in the **External Integration Matrix**, while preserving its governance-first, uncertainty-aware core.

---

## 1. Pattern & Topology Codification

**Action:**

## 🧠 MAPi v5.6‑dev — Manifest‑Aware Prompt Interpreter  
A pattern language for drift‑resistant, audit‑enforced, adaptive agentic AI orchestration — with modular Quantum Readiness, Runaway Guardrails, **and Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework** [ADDED]

**Version:** 5.6‑dev [UPDATED]  
**Status:** Authoritative, posterity‑ready (development branch for uncertainty‑management integration) [UPDATED]

**Purpose:**  
MAPi is a governance‑first, inheritance‑safe framework for designing, tuning, and orchestrating AI agents. It enumerates governance heuristics (PG), rulesets (RS), metrics, and scenario validations to ensure agents remain drift‑resistant, auditable, and adaptable over time. Governance roles themselves are embodied as cooperating agents, exchanging messages to execute the manifest in real time.  

**[ADDED]** In v5.6‑dev, MAPi incorporates the **Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework (TTUF)** — a cross‑agent protocol for measuring, logging, and resolving epistemic uncertainty before action in domains with non‑lenient hallucination tolerance. TTUF introduces new modules (`UNCERTAINTY‑MGMT`, `DOMAIN‑PROFILE`, `CONF‑METRICS`, `EPISTEMIC‑FLAGS`), updated orchestration rules, and mandatory metadata tags to ensure downstream agents inherit confidence scores, prior exposure data, and resolution history. This elevates truthful uncertainty from an optional behavior to a governance requirement in trust‑critical contexts.

**Scope:**  
This manifest is domain‑agnostic and modular. Chunks 1–4 define the classical core; Chunk 5 adds an opt‑in control plane for early‑stage quantum readiness and runaway prevention; Chunks 9, 11, and 17 embed automation‑ready governance and benchmarking.  
**[ADDED]** TTUF modules apply across all chunks, with domain‑specific tolerance profiles determining abstention, clarification, or escalation behavior. All uncertainty events are logged, mirrored, and auditable.

**Usage:**  
Each new agent inherits from MAPi Prime, toggling PG/RS as mandatory or optional, and may extend with agent‑specific rules. All changes are versioned for audit and legacy handoff, with v5.5 enforcing before/after metrics capture, commit‑tagged artifacts, and automated ritual execution.  
**[ADDED]** In v5.6‑dev, agents must also:  
- Emit `conf_score`, `conf_thresh`, `prior_exposure`, and `epistemic_flag` in all decision artifacts.  
- Respect `DOMAIN‑PROFILE` policies for hallucination tolerance and error cost.  
- Attempt resolution via `clarify_prompts` before abstaining in STRICT domains.  
- Carry forward upstream uncertainty metadata to all downstream decisions.

---

**What’s New in v5.6‑dev** [UPDATED]  
(See Change Log entry `CHG-2025-09-12-MAPi-v5.6-dev` in `/MAPi_Prime/Change_Logs/`)

**Chunk 9 — Change Management & Version Control**  
- Added PG‑CM8 (metrics‑integrated validation mandate) and PG‑CM9 (automation traceability).  
- New RS‑CM108 (automated inbox state update), RS‑CM109 (threshold gate), and RS‑CM110 (commit & tag).  
- All changes now require before/after metrics capture; breaches block activation or trigger rollback.  
- **[ADDED]** New PG‑CM10: All change artifacts must include uncertainty metadata; threshold gates now evaluate `conf_score` against `conf_thresh` per `DOMAIN‑PROFILE`.  
- **[ADDED]** New RS‑CM111: If `epistemic_flag=true` in a STRICT domain, change is auto‑routed to clarification or escalation before commit.

**Chunk 11 — Governance Rituals & Cadence**  
- All rituals are automation‑ready and metrics‑instrumented.  
- Ritual outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to related change logs, scenarios, and metrics snapshots.  
- Missed rituals must be logged with reason; cadence overrides supported for high‑risk agents.  
- **[ADDED]** Rituals in STRICT domains must include an “Uncertainty Resolution” step, logging `resolution_path` and `post_resolution_conf`.

**Chunk 17 — Archetype Performance Benchmarking**  
- Benchmarks now run via automation runner with archetype‑level configs.  
- Before/after metrics capture with deltas; breaches trigger RS‑CM109 threshold gate.  
- Outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to metrics, scenarios, and change logs.  
- **[ADDED]** Benchmarks now include uncertainty‑aware performance metrics: abstention rate, clarification success rate, and delta in `conf_score` post‑resolution.

**Flow Summary — v5.5**<br>  
**Core Foundation (Ch. 1–5):** The kernel, operational patterns, reasoning core, orchestration/governance, and optional quantum guardrails.<br>  
**Agent Birth (Ch. 6–8):** Creation workflow, metrics wiring, and dry‑run validation before deployment.<br>  
**Governance in Motion (Ch. 9–12):** Change control now threshold‑gated with metrics‑integrated validation, automation‑ready rituals, and artifact‑committed outputs.<br>  
**Resilience Layer (Ch. 13–14):** Incident handling and continuity strategies.<br>  
**Lifecycle Closure (Ch. 15–17):** Controlled retirement, archetype governance, and automation‑ready performance benchmarking with before/after metrics and delta‑driven triggers.<br>  
**Feedback Loop:** Metrics, scenario results, and governance learnings feed back into MAPi Prime and archetype evolution.<br>


## **Chunk 0.2 — Quick‑Start Governance Playbook** *(v5.6‑dev adjustments)*  
**Purpose:** Provide a minimal, high‑impact guide to operating MAPi Prime and its agents in compliance with the full v5.6‑dev framework. This is not a replacement for the full manifest — it’s the field‑ready version.<br>

---

### **1 — Core Mindset**  
- **MAPi Prime is the law** — all agents inherit from it unless explicitly overridden.<br>
- **PG/RS codes are contracts** — if you change them, you log them (Chunk 9).<br>
- **Metrics, scenarios, and uncertainty logs are your truth** — if they say something’s wrong, it’s wrong.<br>
- **TTUF is non‑optional** — all decisions carry uncertainty metadata; unresolved uncertainty must be addressed before action.<br>

---

### **2 — Agent Lifecycle in 8 Moves** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
1. **Create** — Use **Chunk 6** workflow. Pick archetype, set PG/RS toggles, bind tools, tag version.<br>
2. **Wire Metrics** — Apply **Chunk 7** schema before first run.<br>
3. **Wire TTUF Hooks** — Enable DECISION_LOG, UNCERTAINTY_LOG, and EPISTEMIC_FLAGS tracking from first scenario.<br>
4. **Dry‑Run Validate** — Run **Chunk 8** scenarios; fix breaches and resolve uncertainty flags before go‑live.<br>
5. **Deploy** — Move to production only after passing validation and clearing all TTUF‑flagged uncertainty.<br>
6. **Govern** — Follow **Chunks 9–12** for change control, roles, rituals, repository discipline, and uncertainty resolution rituals.<br>
7. **Respond** — Use **Chunks 13–14** for incidents and continuity; log uncertainty context for post‑mortem.<br>
8. **Retire/Evolve** — Apply **Chunks 15–17** for decommissioning, archetype management, and benchmarking; include uncertainty deltas in before/after metrics.<br>

---

### **3 — Daily/Weekly Habits** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
- **Daily:** Check metrics dashboard (MT1–MT6, MT‑Q), scan for drift, triage escalations, review new uncertainty flags.<br>
- **Weekly:** Spot‑run RS8 scenarios, review draft changes, monitor trends, resolve lingering uncertainty logs.<br>
- **Monthly:** Full metrics audit, regression suite, policy effectiveness review, TTUF compliance check.<br>
- **Quarterly:** Archetype portfolio review, MAPi Prime drift audit, uncertainty trend analysis.<br>
- **Annually:** Strategic governance review, full manifest re‑certification, TTUF protocol refresh.<br>

---

### **4 — Change Management in 6 Steps** *(Chunk 9 — v5.6‑dev)*  
1. Log the change proposal in the Change Log.<br>
2. Run impact analysis (affected PG/RS, agents, scenarios, metrics, uncertainty profile).<br>
3. Validate with RS8 scenarios **and capture Metrics_Before/After**; reject if thresholds or uncertainty limits breached.<br>
4. Approve via governance authority.<br>
5. Increment version, commit/tag artifacts, update inbox, monitor post‑change metrics and uncertainty logs.<br>
6. Archive uncertainty resolution notes in governance repository (Chunk 12).<br>

---

### **5 — Incident Response in 6 Steps** *(Chunk 13 — TTUF‑aware)*  
1. Detect (metrics breach, scenario fail, manual report, uncertainty spike).<br>
2. Contain (isolate agent, secure data, kill switch if quantum).<br>
3. Investigate (root cause, impact, preserve evidence, review uncertainty logs).<br>

- Confidence thresholds must be manifest‑defined; default is `conf_score ≥ conf_thresh` before action.<br>
- Any override to hygiene, reliability rituals, or TTUF protocols must be logged in Change Log (Chunk 9) with before/after metrics and uncertainty deltas.<br>


## **Chunk 2A — Collaboration & Operational Layer** *(v5.6‑dev)*  
**Purpose:** Multi‑agent coordination and self‑reflection patterns, with native TTUF hooks for uncertainty measurement, logging, and resolution. Covers Inter‑Agent Dialogue Patterns and Reflective Agency Patterns end‑to‑end.<br>

---

### **X. Inter‑Agent Dialogue Patterns**  
| RS Code | Name | Purpose | TTUF Integration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RS6.140 | Agent‑as‑Tool Invocation | One agent calls another to perform a subtask with explicit role, scope, and expected output. | Log invocation with DECISION_LOG linking parent/child tasks; propagate EPISTEMIC_FLAGS to callee; merge UNCERTAINTY_LOG on return. |
| RS6.141 | Predictive Transparency | Agent previews intended actions or reasoning path to build trust. | Pre‑commit confidence posting to DECISION_LOG; record pre/post confidence delta. |
| RS6.142 | Metacognitive Annotation | Tag steps with source, strategy, confidence for audit. | Write per‑step confidence and cause codes; auto‑flag gaps as uncertainty events. |
| RS6.143 | Signature‑Conditioned Reasoning | Follow a defined cognitive fingerprint (skeptical, analogical, etc.). | Bind signature to TTUF profile; compare expected vs. observed uncertainty pattern. |
| RS6.144 | Theory‑of‑Mind Injection | Simulate another agent’s interpretation or reasoning. | Dual‑track logs: simulated vs. actual confidence; escalate if divergence exceeds threshold. |
| RS6.145 | Divergence‑Aware Communication | Highlight disagreements for ensemble synthesis. | Compute branch uncertainty and disagreement score; escalate if above policy gate. |
| RS6.146 | Trust Calibration | Adjust reliance based on historical reliability. | Update agent‑level trust priors; store uncertainty‑weighted performance metrics. |
| RS6.147 | Cognitive Translation | Bridge representational gaps between agents. | Record translation loss as uncertainty delta; add glossary patches to reduce recurrence. |
| RS6.148 | Collaborative Debug | Jointly identify and resolve errors with rollback logic. | Attach uncertainty cause codes to error events; require resolution notes before close. |
| RS6.149 | Cognitive Team Composition | Assemble complementary agent teams. | Choose team mix to minimize aggregate uncertainty; log pre/post team uncertainty. |
| RS6.150 | Meta‑Learning Update | Learn from collaboration and update heuristics. | Capture “uncertainty reduction per iteration” metric; store update provenance. |
| RS6.151 | Cognitive Conflict Invocation | Pair divergent styles to expose blind spots. | Force exploration of high‑uncertainty branches; log reconciliation method/impact. |
| RS6.152 | Perspective‑Switch | Solve using another agent’s style and compare. | Side‑by‑side DECISION_LOG entries; auto‑flag large confidence deltas. |
| RS6.153 | Real‑Time Attribution | Live contribution tags for audit and synthesis. | Attribute uncertainty impact to contributors; support accountability roll‑ups. |
| RS6.154 | Theory‑of‑Mind Simulation | Simulate another agent’s full chain‑of‑thought. | Step‑level uncertainty mirroring; flag simulation fidelity gaps for review. |

---

### **XI. Reflective Agency Patterns**  
| RS Code | Name | Purpose | TTUF Integration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RS6.160 | Self‑Critique Loop | Review and critique outputs; identify flaws/gaps. | Require uncertainty reconciliation notes before closure; log remaining flags. |
| RS6.161 | Confidence Calibration | Implement confidence reporting per PG6.30. | Compare conf_score to conf_thresh; block action if below; log rationale. |
| RS6.162 | Intent Drift Detection | Compare current behavior to original goal. | Flag drift as uncertainty event; require scope re‑confirmation entry. |
| RS6.163 | Inner Dialogue Simulation | Run skeptic/optimist voices to widen reasoning. | Record polarity spread of confidence; escalate if unresolved spread persists. |
| RS6.164 | Reflection‑as‑a‑Service | Trigger structured self‑reflection on demand. | Standardize reflection schema; capture uncertainty before/after reflection. |
| RS6.165 | Escalation Trigger Prompting | Conditions for human handoff/external intervention. | Define uncertainty gates for escalation; write handoff context packet. |
| RS6.166 | Retry with Modifications | Re‑attempt with targeted adjustments. | Track uncertainty reduction per retry; stop after max attempts or plateau. |

---

**Operational guidance**<br>
- **Propagation:** Always propagate EPISTEMIC_FLAGS when invoking or composing agents; callers are responsible for merging UNCERTAINTY_LOG results.<br>
- **Thresholds:** Collaboration actions must respect conf_thresh and disagreement gates; if breached, invoke RS6.165 escalation or RS6.160 self‑critique before proceeding.<br>
- **Attribution:** Use RS6.153 to attribute uncertainty impact to specific contributors to improve accountability and learning loops.<br>

**Cross‑links**<br>
- **Core Kernel:** Chunk 1 (inheritance, hygiene)<br>
- **Reasoning Core:** Chunk 3 (confidence policies, thresholds)<br>
- **Orchestration & Governance:** Chunk 4 (ensemble policies), Chunk 9 (change control)<br>
- **Repository & Logs:** Chunk 12 (DECISION_LOG, UNCERTAINTY_LOG storage)<br>
- **Uncertainty Management:** Chunk 18 (TTUF protocols)<br>

**Usage notes**<br>
- Document all collaboration sessions as discrete artifacts with parent/child linkage in DECISION_LOG; unresolved flags must carry forward until explicitly cleared.<br>
- When trust calibration (RS6.146) changes routing decisions, update the agent trust profile and note uncertainty deltas as part of governance records.<br>


## **Chunk 2B — Operational Governance & Hygiene Layer** *(v5.6‑dev)*  
**Purpose:** Defines the governance rules for how agents manage tools, enforce operational discipline, and maintain semantic hygiene. Codifies the Priming Groups (PG1–PG7) — the high‑level governance heuristics that underpin all RS implementations. Ensures every agent operates within clear, auditable boundaries, preserves context integrity, and can adapt policies without introducing drift — now with TTUF uncertainty‑management embedded.<br>

---

| RS6.171 | Agentic Persistence Priming | Maintain agent identity across interactions; reinforce role and constraints. | Track identity drift as uncertainty; log in UNCERTAINTY_LOG. |
| RS6.172 | Tool Use Governance | Define tool constraints, preconditions, allowed operations, and logging requirements. | Record tool invocation confidence; flag risky/ambiguous tool calls. |
| RS6.173 | Planning‑Reflection Sandwich | Plan → Execute → Reflect cadence for tool‑assisted tasks. | Capture pre/post execution uncertainty; require resolution before close. |
| RS6.174 | Positional Reinforcement | Use instruction placement to emphasize priority and persistence. | Flag priority conflicts as uncertainty events. |
| RS6.175 | Role Override via Ordering | When instructions conflict, later, higher‑priority role assertions take precedence. | Log override rationale and uncertainty delta. |

| RS6.177 | Tool Schema Hygiene | Ensure tool schemas are clearly defined and consistently used. | Flag schema ambiguity; require clarification before execution. |
| RS6.178 | Failure Mode Preemption | Anticipate and mitigate known tool failure modes; add guards. | Log preemptive uncertainty mitigation actions. |

**Purpose:** Provides a minimal, high‑integrity control plane for safely engaging with early‑stage quantum capabilities in hybrid AI systems. **Opt‑in** — dormant unless a workflow explicitly declares quantum use — and designed to prevent uncontrolled escalation (“quantum runaway”), protect sensitive data/models, and ensure ethical/governance compliance. Other PG/RS codes in Chunks 1–4 may reference these rules when quantum workflows are invoked. TTUF hooks ensure uncertainty is measured, logged, and resolved before and after quantum execution.<br>

- **Cross‑References:**<br>
    - RS6.165 (Escalation Trigger Prompting) — used by RS‑Q104 with uncertainty context.<br>
    - RS8 (Scenario Validation) — extended with quantum scenarios and uncertainty logging.<br>
    - Metrics & Telemetry — MT‑Q entries appended to MT1–MT6 and CONF‑METRICS.<br>
- **Runaway Prevention:** PG‑Q2 + RS‑Q101/RS‑Q104 form the “kill switch” for unsafe quantum escalation; TTUF ensures uncertainty is measured, logged, and resolved before continuation.<br>

2. **If Fail:** Apply targeted RS7 policy changes; re‑run affected scenarios until pass criteria and uncertainty thresholds are met.<br>

---

### **Output Artifacts** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
- **Scenario Outcome Log** (RS8.304) — Full record of runs, results, corrective actions, and uncertainty events.<br>
- **Metrics Dashboard Snapshot** — Populated Chunk 7 schema for the dry run, including CONF‑METRICS.<br>
- **Go/No‑Go Report** — Decision rationale, signed off by governance authority, with uncertainty resolution summary.<br>



## **Chunk 9 — Change Management & Version Control** *(v5.6‑dev)*  
**Purpose:** Ensure that all modifications to MAPi Prime and MAPi‑governed agents are deliberate, documented, validated, metrics‑instrumented, uncertainty‑tracked, automatable, and reversible. Provides governance scaffolding for tracking, approving, and auditing changes, preventing silent drift, preserving operational integrity, and enforcing TTUF uncertainty‑resolution before activation.<br>

---

### **PG‑CM — Change Management Governance Heuristics** *(TTUF‑aware)*  
- **PG‑CM1 — Version tagging discipline:** Require version tags for MAPi Prime and all agents; increment on any PG/RS change; log uncertainty profile at version cut.<br>
- **PG‑CM2 — Change log mandate:** Maintain an immutable, chronological log of all changes, including uncertainty deltas.<br>
- **PG‑CM3 — Validation before activation:** Require RS8 scenario validation and TTUF uncertainty clearance before any change goes live.<br>
- **PG‑CM4 — Rollback preparedness:** Ensure every change has a defined rollback path (RS7.203) and uncertainty rollback plan.<br>
- **PG‑CM5 — Scope declaration:** Declare whether a change is global (MAPi Prime), archetype‑specific, or agent‑specific.<br>
- **PG‑CM6 — Metrics baseline shift:** Capture pre‑ and post‑change metrics (Chunk 7 schema) and CONF‑METRICS for comparison.<br>
- **PG‑CM7 — Auditability:** All changes traceable to a Change Log entry with rationale, validation reference, and uncertainty resolution notes.<br>
- **PG‑CM8 — Metrics‑integrated validation mandate:** Validation must include Metrics_Before, Metrics_After, CONF‑METRICS_Before, CONF‑METRICS_After; apply threshold checks; reject if breaches or unresolved uncertainty.<br>
- **PG‑CM9 — Automation traceability:** Automated runs must produce atomic artifacts (outbox, change logs, scenario results, metrics, uncertainty logs) and create signed/timestamped commits and tags for recovery.<br>

- Capture `Metrics_Before` and `CONF_Before` snapshots.<br>
- Aggregate into archetype‑level metrics and uncertainty metrics.<br>

**Scenario Validation Runs**<br>
- Execute RS8 baseline scenarios for each archetype quarterly.<br>
- Capture `Metrics_After` and `CONF_After` snapshots immediately post‑run.<br>
- Record pass/fail rates, deviations, metric deltas, and uncertainty deltas.<br>

**Weighting & Scoring**<br>
- Apply governance weighting factors (APB‑1.4) to both performance and uncertainty metrics.<br>
- Produce a composite Archetype Performance Score (APS) and Archetype Uncertainty Score (AUS).<br>
- Flag any breaches per `/Config/thresholds.csv` (threshold gate) for both sets.<br>

- Identify top and bottom performers in both APS and AUS.<br>

**Action Triggers**<br>
- APS ≥ 90 and AUS ≥ target: Candidate for best‑practice template.<br>
- APS 70–89 or AUS below target: Monitor; minor tuning if trends decline.<br>
- APS < 70 or AUS critical breach: Trigger Chunk 16 evolution or retirement workflow.<br>

## **Chunk 18 — Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework (TTUF)** *(v5.6‑dev)*  
**Purpose:** Define the governance‑grade framework for measuring, logging, resolving, and learning from uncertainty in MAPi‑governed agents. TTUF ensures that all decisions, outputs, and state changes are accompanied by explicit confidence scoring, uncertainty cause tracking, and resolution workflows — making trustworthiness auditable and inheritable.<br>

---

### **TTUF‑1 — Core Principles**  
| Code | Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TTUF‑1.1 | Explicit Confidence | Every decision/output must carry a `conf_score` and `conf_thresh` comparison. |
| TTUF‑1.2 | Cause Code Discipline | All uncertainty events must be tagged with standardized cause codes. |
| TTUF‑1.3 | Resolution Before Action | If `conf_score < conf_thresh`, resolution is mandatory before execution. |
| TTUF‑1.4 | Persistent Logging | All uncertainty events are written to `UNCERTAINTY_LOG` with timestamps, context, and resolution status. |
| TTUF‑1.5 | Inheritance Safety | Uncertainty metadata must persist across agent hand‑offs, archetype inheritance, and fallback modes. |
| TTUF‑1.6 | Governance Integration | TTUF hooks are mandatory in all PG/RS implementations; breaches trigger RS‑CM109 threshold gates. |

---

### **TTUF‑2 — Data Structures**  
**UNCERTAINTY_LOG Entry Schema** *(stored in `/Uncertainty_Logs` per Chunk 12)*<br>
| Field | Description | Example |

1. **Detection** — PG/RS pattern detects uncertainty; logs to UNCERTAINTY_LOG.<br>
2. **Classification** — Assign cause code and severity.<br>
3. **Resolution Attempt** — Apply resolution pattern (clarification, re‑anchoring, tool substitution, etc.).<br>
4. **Re‑Evaluation** — Recalculate `conf_score`; compare to `conf_thresh`.<br>
5. **Escalation** — If unresolved and severity ≥ High, trigger RS6.165 escalation.<br>
6. **Closure** — Mark as Resolved with action notes; link to DECISION_LOG and any Change Log entries.<br>

---
