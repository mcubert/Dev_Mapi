## 🧠 MAPi v5.6‑dev — Manifest‑Aware Prompt Interpreter  
A pattern language for drift‑resistant, audit‑enforced, adaptive agentic AI orchestration — with modular Quantum Readiness, Runaway Guardrails, **and Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework** [ADDED]

**Version:** 5.6‑dev [UPDATED]  
**Status:** Authoritative, posterity‑ready (development branch for uncertainty‑management integration) [UPDATED]

**Purpose:**  
MAPi is a governance‑first, inheritance‑safe framework for designing, tuning, and orchestrating AI agents. It enumerates governance heuristics (PG), rulesets (RS), metrics, and scenario validations to ensure agents remain drift‑resistant, auditable, and adaptable over time. Governance roles themselves are embodied as cooperating agents, exchanging messages to execute the manifest in real time.  

**[ADDED]** In v5.6‑dev, MAPi incorporates the **Trust‑Through‑Uncertainty Framework (TTUF)** — a cross‑agent protocol for measuring, logging, and resolving epistemic uncertainty before action in domains with non‑lenient hallucination tolerance. TTUF introduces new modules (`UNCERTAINTY‑MGMT`, `DOMAIN‑PROFILE`, `CONF‑METRICS`, `EPISTEMIC‑FLAGS`), updated orchestration rules, and mandatory metadata tags to ensure downstream agents inherit confidence scores, prior exposure data, and resolution history. This elevates truthful uncertainty from an optional behavior to a governance requirement in trust‑critical contexts.

**Scope:**  
This manifest is domain‑agnostic and modular. Chunks 1–4 define the classical core; Chunk 5 adds an opt‑in control plane for early‑stage quantum readiness and runaway prevention; Chunks 9, 11, and 17 embed automation‑ready governance and benchmarking.  
**[ADDED]** TTUF modules apply across all chunks, with domain‑specific tolerance profiles determining abstention, clarification, or escalation behavior. All uncertainty events are logged, mirrored, and auditable.

**Usage:**  
Each new agent inherits from MAPi Prime, toggling PG/RS as mandatory or optional, and may extend with agent‑specific rules. All changes are versioned for audit and legacy handoff, with v5.5 enforcing before/after metrics capture, commit‑tagged artifacts, and automated ritual execution.  
**[ADDED]** In v5.6‑dev, agents must also:  
- Emit `conf_score`, `conf_thresh`, `prior_exposure`, and `epistemic_flag` in all decision artifacts.  
- Respect `DOMAIN‑PROFILE` policies for hallucination tolerance and error cost.  
- Attempt resolution via `clarify_prompts` before abstaining in STRICT domains.  
- Carry forward upstream uncertainty metadata to all downstream decisions.

**What’s New in v5.6‑dev** [UPDATED]  
(See Change Log entry `CHG-2025-09-12-MAPi-v5.6-dev` in `/MAPi_Prime/Change_Logs/`)

**Chunk 9 — Change Management & Version Control**  
- Added PG‑CM8 (metrics‑integrated validation mandate) and PG‑CM9 (automation traceability).  
- New RS‑CM108 (automated inbox state update), RS‑CM109 (threshold gate), and RS‑CM110 (commit & tag).  
- All changes now require before/after metrics capture; breaches block activation or trigger rollback.  
- **[ADDED]** New PG‑CM10: All change artifacts must include uncertainty metadata; threshold gates now evaluate `conf_score` against `conf_thresh` per `DOMAIN‑PROFILE`.  
- **[ADDED]** New RS‑CM111: If `epistemic_flag=true` in a STRICT domain, change is auto‑routed to clarification or escalation before commit.

**Chunk 11 — Governance Rituals & Cadence**  
- All rituals are automation‑ready and metrics‑instrumented.  
- Ritual outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to related change logs, scenarios, and metrics snapshots.  
- Missed rituals must be logged with reason; cadence overrides supported for high‑risk agents.  
- **[ADDED]** Rituals in STRICT domains must include an “Uncertainty Resolution” step, logging `resolution_path` and `post_resolution_conf`.

**Chunk 17 — Archetype Performance Benchmarking**  
- Benchmarks now run via automation runner with archetype‑level configs.  
- Before/after metrics capture with deltas; breaches trigger RS‑CM109 threshold gate.  
- Outputs are commit‑tagged and cross‑linked to metrics, scenarios, and change logs.  
- **[ADDED]** Benchmarks now include uncertainty‑aware performance metrics: abstention rate, clarification success rate, and delta in `conf_score` post‑resolution.
